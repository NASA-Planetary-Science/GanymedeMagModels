Calculations:

In Matlab or Octave, initialize the Slepian software:

initialize

Make sure that you set the path in initialize to the correct path of your Slepian codes, or just copy all the codes into your Slepian folder.
Then run makeMyField(g10,Lmax,filename), for example

makeMyField(-700,3,'Lmax_3_g10_-700_allGalileoTracks')

Plotting:

In the command line, run ./makeMyFigs.sh filename for example:

./makeMyFigs.sh Lmax_3_g10_-700_allGalileoTracks

For the plotting you need to have GMT 6 installed.

The figures are saved in the "figures" folder
