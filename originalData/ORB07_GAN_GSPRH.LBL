      This ASCII table contains MAG and trajectory data in spherical          
      Ganymede-centered right handed planetocentric (GSPRH) coordinates.      
      The GSPRH magnetic field vector components form the standard            
      right-handed spherical triad (R, Theta, Phi). R is along the            
      satellite to spacecraft line, positive away from the satellite. Phi     
      is parellel to the satellite's planetographic equator and positive in   
      a right-handed sense.  Theta completes the right-handed set (positive   
      southward). The trajectory components are also right-handed. R is       
      radial distance expressed in units of RG = 2634 km. Latitude is         
      planetocentric. Longitude is measured from the prime meridian and
