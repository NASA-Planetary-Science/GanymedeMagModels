function makeMyField(g10,Lmax,filename)
  % makeMyField(g10,Lmax,filename)
  %
  % Example:
  %
  % makeMyField(-700,3,'Lmax_3_g10_-700_allGalileoTracks')
  %
  % Calculates a magnetic field model for Ganymede given a maximum
  % spherical-harmonic degree Lmax and a choice for g10. Try for
  % example g10 = -700
  %
  % You also need to provide a filename as which the coefficients
  % will be saved
  %
  % You can choose which tracks to use. Track 101 is Juno's first track
  % From June 07, 2021
  %
  % The saved coefficients are normalized in the same way as the
  % coefficients published by Kivelson (fully normalized, with a
  % factor 2), because they used the cartesian formulation.
  %
  % The uniform field values are also saved in the coefficients. They
  % are ordered by tracks as is set in the variable "tracks" in this
  % function. For each track the order of the uniform field values is
  % X, Y, Z. So you have G1 X, G1 Y, G1 Z, G2 X, G2 Y, etc
